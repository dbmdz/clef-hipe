For the rest of the personal pronouns, the inclusive emphatic particle hī must come after the pronoun in ergative case and never between the pronoun and the postposition ne. So, rather than *ma͠i-hī-ne, it's periphrastically constructed as ma͠ine hī. As for the non-personal pronouns, both ways of constructing the emphatic forms are gramamtically valid. So, for e.g. the demonstrative proximal singular emphatic pronoun isīne and isne hī are synonymous. The emphatic forms for the relative pronouns are constructed periphrastically as well, but they instead use the inclusive emphatic particle bhī.

Orko is a Trollan, a race of beings from Trolla, a world in another dimension. Trollans wear red robes, red hats, and hide their faces beneath hats and behind scarves. In Trollan society, showing one's face to each other is considered an intimate act, similar to humans sharing a kiss. A production drawing of Orko without his hat showed him resembling little blue elf, but it was never used in the series. Orko does reveal his face in the episode \"Dawn of Dragoon\", but his face is not visible to the audience, though his shadow indicates he is bald. Trollans appear to be blue-skinned humanoids with pointy ears. However, their feet remain hidden under their robes. Trollans have natural magical abilities, including levitation, which they use exclusively instead of walking. In one episode, Orko temporarily loses the power of levitation, and can be seen crawling around on his knees. Still, some Trollans have greater magical power than others; Orko's uncle, for example, is a noted magician. Orko knows He-Man's true identity.", "She can't accept it because Tan and her sister are the one that she loves. Later, Tan breaks up with Orn. Then, he writes a letter to June expressing his love.

Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The strophe and the antistrophe of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode.

Triads are found for example in plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, in odes by Pindar and Bacchylides, and they are known also to have been characteristic of the poetry of Stesichorus.

The arrangement of an ode in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, antistrophe and epode was carried to its height by Pindar.", "In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas."]}

Occasionally the Baptists would hold rallies promoting membership drives, domestic missions, Christian education, religious literature, prayer in the home, Christian citizenship, and one outside issue, laws to promote temperance. Until the late 19th century, the preachers continued to focus on the need for revivals, and Sabbath observance, on the evils of Catholicism, card playing, dancing and personal sin in general. Every few weeks the churches held trials of their own members for sins such as drunkenness, dancing, or adultery; the usual participant punishment was humiliation or expulsion from the congregation. The theology was traditional, with no trace of modernist readings of the Bible. Unlike the Methodists and Presbyterians, few Baptist pastors were educated. Instead, the local congregation selected and ordained ministers on the basis of their religiosity and ability to articulate God's word. By 1900, the range of sermons and editorials had been enlarged to cover new social themes. Baptists still opposed Catholicism, but now they talked of cooperation with other Protestant churches. There was less emphasis on card playing and dancing, and more interest in issues of underpaid laborers, coal miners, and workers in sweatshops.

Reparative readings \"contrasts with familiar academic protocols like maintaining critical distance, outsmarting (and other forms of one-upmanship), refusing to be surprised (or if you are, then not letting on), believing the hierarchy, becoming boss.\" Rita Felski argues that reparative reading can be defined as \"a stance that looks to a work of art for solace and replenishment rather than viewing it as something to be interrogated and indicted.\" Felski's claims around postcritique and postcritical reading draw heavily on Sedgwick's reparative approach.", "There are a number of factors that make this piece of writing unique. First of all, the language of the text is not of classical modern Irish like most pieces of literature from the era. Writing poetry and prose was largely dominated by the professional poets and so the vast majority of surviving texts were written in their high-register.  It is unlike the formal language of professional poetry, but similar to the language that was spoken at the time.  Secondly, it is unusual because of its focus on the poet as a prominent character. Tromdámh Guaire was notably produced by an author who was outside the circle of professional poets, but who knew of the Bardic Order and the tradition of professional poets. This is apparent when reading the text. Thirdly, the text contains at least one riddle, examples of which are very rare in medieval Irish literature. Thus, when Marban returns to the hall to punish the poets, his wisdom is tested through a number of questions, including the following riddle: 'What good thing did man find on earth that God did not find?—A worthy master.'", "Beyond this  in both the Codices Job 1:6 and Deuteronomy 32:8 when the phrase \"angels of God\"  is used in place of where the Hebrew says \"sons of God\".

Therefore, Marx explains, the value of a commodity does not stay constant as it advances or it varies in labour productivity which may occur for many reasons. However, value does not mean anything unless it conjoins back to use-value. If a commodity is produced and no one wants it or it has no use, then \"the labour does not count as labour\" and therefore it has no value. He also says that one can produce use-value without being a commodity. If one produces something solely for his own benefit or need, he has produced use-value, but no commodity. Value can only be derived when the commodity has use-value for others. Marx calls this social use-value. He writes all of this to explain that all aspects of the commodity (use-value, exchange-value and value) are all separate from each other, but they are also essentially connected to each other."]}

They then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs. the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a light beam traveling parallel to the flow of that aether will take longer to reflect back and forth than would a beam traveling perpendicular to the aether, because the increase in elapsed time from traveling against the aether wind is more than the time saved by traveling with the aether wind.  Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 0.04 fringes—that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.", "Frame-dragging", "Drag/dragging"]}

Agamemnon, wearing armor of Hephaestus, killed Antilochus, son of Nestor, which caused Achilles to become enraged. In his rage, Achilles kills Agamemnon and proceeds into the gates of Troy to inflict more casualties on Trojan army. As he entered the gates of Troy, Achilles was fatally struck with an arrow shot by Paris, assisted by Apollo. Odysseus and Ajax retrieved the body of Achilles. The Achaeans then hold burial rights for both Antilochus and Achilles. The burial of Achilles is attended by the goddess mother of Achilles, Thetis, along with her sisters and the muses.

With the help of Athena, the arms are awarded to Odysseus, and Ajax goes insane and attacks the Achaeans' herd.

Apollodorus mentions the embassy of Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax, to Achilles.

Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide.

All movements are not the same; there are movements to be avoided. For example, movement that alternates between different awkward sitting postures that repeatedly load the same joints will provide little benefit. The benefits of active sitting are understood to occur with movements through a graded range of centered and symmetrical postures. The active and controlled postural positions in sitting are believed to activate and strengthen muscles in the back and core area,  to relieve the static loads acting on joints, ligaments, and tendons, and to promote circulation for elimination of waste products.

Before Wundt, there were many other theorists that associated thought with language. Many argued that silent thinking was a form of talking with oneself. Wundt did not agree with this idea. He came up with several situations in which a person's thoughts do not fully do justice to what they are actually thinking. When having conversations, people may tend to say \"That's not what I had meant to say\" or may wonder why they said something, when they realize that they are saying something which might not accurately depict what they are thinking internally. People will do this all the time, and this was a topic that Wundt used Völkerpsychologie to study. When someone disagrees with a statement that someone has made in conversation, we may find ourselves interrupting with a \"What? Wait a minute, you are incorrect!\" long before we can describe the actual point of disagreement. We tend to say things before our mind understands exactly why we say them.

Because its abilities are primarily tied to its magnetic field, it is susceptible to magnetic attacks that disrupt said field. Weaker magnetism from devices such as the Guardian's improvised fist-load weapons are capable of disrupting or disabling the T-3000's shapeshifting and regeneration abilities, due to affecting its ability to manipulate its particles. A sufficiently strong magnetic field can pull the T-3000 apart briefly to restrain it, and, if its body is exposed to a powerful magnetic field for a sustained amount of time, the cyborg can be torn apart and destroyed. The machine-phase matter is also vulnerable to the laser used in shaping mimetic polyalloy for use in the construction of T-1000s. If struck by this laser, the T-3000 can suffer enough external damage to render its outermost layer irreparably compromised, forcing it to discard its human appearance and use its true machine form. The T-3000 is still susceptible to some degrees of physical injuries and pains such as being wounded by gunshot, and its agonies can worsen if being marred by SWAT-standard breaching rounds since they typically are magnetic; the explosive ones are more effective against the cyborg for minutes of impairment.

While outsourcing, the busting and decline of unionization and welfare supports, and the rise of immigration, the prison-industrial complex, and unemployment have brought increased competition and considerable economic insecurity to working-class employees in the \"traditional\" blue-collar fields, there is an increasing demand for service personnel, including clerical and retail occupations. Sociologist Gosta Esping-Anderson describes these supervised service occupations as \"junk jobs,\" as they fail to pay living wages in the face of asset and price inflation, fail to pay benefits, are often insecure, unstable, or temporary, and provide little work control and little opportunity for skill development or advancement. In contrast to other expensive countries with higher proportions of quality jobs, the U.S. has developed an economy where two-thirds of jobs do not require or reward higher education; the other one-third of jobs consist largely in managing the junk job workers. Recalling this American labor market reality as well as the high cost of higher education in the US, lower educational attainment can be a rational calculation. The alternative is probably not a better job. It is the junk job, with educational debt added on top. In fact, even if more Americans were to become highly educated, there would be more competition for the relatively few high-quality jobs, and those wages would decline. This suggests that the middle and working classes in the US may not be distinct classes, but rather opposing subgroups of the same class.", "Developing the bishop to f4 might seem reasonable at first, but in this particular opening it is not the correct approach by White.

Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. Chromatic aberration of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an achromatic doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step in the development of the optical microscope.

Bulb of applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology. However, bulb of percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas. When a flake is detached from its parent core, a portion of the Hertzian cone of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the bulb of applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone. The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The bulb of applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. Bulbs of applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The bulb of applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the bulb of applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable bulb of applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse bulbs. The bulb of percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative bulb of percussion. Bulbs of applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main bulb types are flat or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A flat or nondescript bulb is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.", "\"I will not be lost with my husbands!\" Video interview <url>"]}

Many Muslim Javanese traders frequented Ternate at the time and incited the king to learn more about the new creed. In c. 1495, he traveled with his companion Hussein to study Islam in Giri (Gresik) on Java's north coast, where Sunan Giri kept a well-known madrasa.  While there, he won renown as Sultan Bualawa, or Sultan of Cloves. He was well respected, known as a valiant warrior and pious scholar, and developed friendships which developed into strong alliances. One story told of his time there is that he stood up to a crazed killer on the rampage while others fled, beheading him with a single stroke."]}

The issue, that how this area was named Dandoka, has been controversial both for historians and archeologists. According to Archeologist the area got its name Dandoka due to its geographic location between to ancient streams. Any natural stream is called dund in Pushto language. As the area is between two natural dund (Streams) so peoples of the time called it Dandoka, This is the view of Archeologist, which is acceptable according to his geographics principles but its a gossip only and wrong information about the history of this village.

She bandies words with Hanne, a gruff servant. Her husband enters, discussing his business as a drayman, carting goods from one place to another.

An' the girl's got a head on her, that's sure, better'n mine.\" Siebenhaar, proprietor of a hotel, encourages him to forget his vow to the dead wife. Now married to Henschel, Hanne is stunned on learning that he has brought with him her daughter, born out of wedlock, from the grips of her irresponsible and drunken father, though she denies that the girl is hers. The death of Gustel may be compensated by the arrival of Berthel. In the tap room of Wermelskirch's public house, several men grumble about the changes in Henschel's character since his second marriage, blaming Hanne.

Speaking of George, a waiter, Walther comments to Henschel: \"Your wife an' he—they c'n compete with each other makin' a fool o' you!\" Henschel challenges his wife: \"He says that you deceive me before my face an' behind my back!\" Says Hanne: \"What?

Damned lies!\", throwing her apron over her face and rushing out. Henschel is more and more despondent. In discussing his marriage woes with Siebenhaar, Henschel reminds him of his broken vow: \"You know well enough!- I broke it an' when I did that, I was lost. I wa done for. The game was up.- An' you see: now she can't find no rest.\" Husband and wife retire for the night. Says Henschel: \"Let it be. To-morrow is another day. Everythin' changes, as Siebenhaar says.

The first factor is purpose. Purpose means what the content is being used for, in reference to commercial, nonprofit, or educational purposes. Also, if the use adds a new aspect or meaning to the content. The second factor is what the copyrighted content is. If the content is non-fiction, it is more likely to full under fair use than if the content is a work of fiction. The third factor is how much of the copyrighted content is in use.

Significant in this regard is the fact that the muscles of the so-called \"lower face\" can be consciously controlled much easier than the muscles of the so-called \"upper face\". And with a smile that seems spurious, certain muscles of the upper face are not involved. As the \"most common emotions that you get to see\", Krause is calling contempt and disgust, which is likely to be contrary to the everyday theories of laypersons in affect-psychology. However, when people talk about their daily lives, the expression of joy is the most frequently shown emotion. Other situations show different rankings of the affects. Krause emphasizes that what is seen in the face of the person who imagines a specific affect is not inevitably what is experienced. Only in expression of joy is there congruence with what is visible in the face and what is internally experienced. Not so with the negative emotions: they are shown more often than experienced. Krause states that this will not allow information-sharing about the relationship between the two persons. He refers to old and often confirmed findings of Bühler (1934), according to which in a communication between a \"sender\" and his \"receiver\" signs of expression should be interpreted differently: as an \"expression for the internal status of the sender\", or in his \"appeal function\" that \"should bring the receiver to a specific action\", or as a kind of \"mental comment\" about something \"the sender is talking or thinking about\".

In this document, Joe Thompson's age is given as 21 years. John Thompson's last will pronounced his strong desire that most of his slaves; including Joe and his wife Nell, be prospectively manumitted after a period of 10 years in servitude. The younger enslaved individuals were to be likewise freed after other specified periods. Most slaves in the District of Columbia were \"slaves for life.\" However a slave granted a prospective manumission became \"a term slave\". For a slaveholder to free a slave by manumission, was to reduce the total value of his or her estate. Even manumission by last will and testament was not always secure for heirs often challenged such testamentary manumissions in court. While John Thompson's will had made provisions for his widow Elizabeth, she through her attorney challenged the will, especially the testamentary manumissions. Following her death, she left the residue of her estate to her brother in law Walter Clarke, 1777 - 1846 who had married Anne Thompson and subsequently became estate administrator. Walter Clarke moved into the District circa 1798 where he became a prominent businessman who served the District of Columbia as an  Alderman and later on the Board of Appeals. Walter Clarke was a slaveholder in his own right purchasing and utilizing slaves both for his business and household. Clarke quickly moved to set aside the provisions of John Thompson's will.

When the Indiana Territory (which included the future State of Illinois) was split from the Northwest Territory in 1800, residents petitioned the United States Senate to allow slaves.

The first signs of change came in the 1740s when church attendance dropped and people began reading religious tracts on their own. This resulted in divisions between the clergy and Virginians and the breakdown of old hierarchical ways. These new sects had little use for the old hierarchical ways, and became popular amongst slaves. Attempts by upper class religious authorities to repress these religious movements only further instigated colonists. These dissenters became more and more distrusting of colonial and British authority which led to the idea of a revolution. Isaac argues this made “the arguments of revolution more persuasive to them”. Lower class Virginians were not willing to pay taxes to a state-supervised church that was considered to be corrupt and pay the controversial revenue taxes imposed by Parliament. The refusal to pay taxes reduced Anglican influence which is based on social standing or aristocratic lineage.  According to Isaac, some of the more extreme revivalists, particularly among the Baptists, even questioned slavery.

While slave marriages were not legally recognized, many families formed unions that lasted, and they struggled to maintain their stability. Some slaves with special skills attained a quasi-free status, being leased out to work on riverboats or in the port cities.

De Witt of course met opposition from  other provinces from time to time, and sometimes Holland was even outvoted in the States General. This posed an unenviable dilemma for De Witt. Although decisions were supposed to be unanimous in the States General, this would in practice be unworkable. The principle of majority voting was therefore accepted by all provinces. On the other hand, Holland could not allow the other provinces to go against its wishes, as the major contributor to the Generality's budget. De Witt was therefore only prepared to accept a majority decision if Holland was in the majority. But how to justify this? The solution was to push the old doctrine of the supremacy of provincial sovereignty (as long as it was Holland's sovereignty), first formulated by François Vranck in 1587. And this became the basic constitutional theory of the Republic during the Stadtholderless Era, at least of De Witt'sStates Party.", "Corky (Jules de Jongh): She is Mort's younger sister.

A brief coalition of populists took over in some states, but Democrats had returned to power after the 1880s. From 1890 to 1908, they proceeded to pass legislation and constitutional amendments to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites, with Mississippi and Louisiana creating new state constitutions in 1890 and 1895 respectively, to disenfranchise African Americans. Democrats used a combination of restrictions on voter registration and voting methods, such as poll taxes, literacy and residency requirements, and ballot box changes. The main push came from elite Democrats in the Solid South, where blacks were a majority of voters. The elite Democrats also acted to disenfranchise poor whites. African Americans were an absolute majority of the population in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, and represented more than 40% of the population in four other former Confederate states. Accordingly, many whites perceived African Americans as a major political threat, because in free and fair elections, they would hold the balance of power in a majority of the South. South Carolina U.S. Senator Ben Tillman proudly proclaimed in 1900, \"We have done our level best [to prevent blacks from voting]... we have scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one of them.

Blacks and whites attended separate schools. Blacks could not serve on juries, which meant that they had little if any legal recourse.

Initially, the police treated the victim as a suspect and the fear of being charged under Article 177 prompted the boy and his family to leave the country. The mother accused the United Arab Emirates authorities of not notifying the family of the victim that one of the rapists was HIV-positive, testing positive 2003, thus delaying the seeking of medical attention for her son. The Dubai Police Chief brushed aside this accusation stating \"The case is a court case ...

During the years 1939–1940 he sang in the Vanemuine choir and after the war and the change of regime he became the long-time theatre director of the Vanemuine. Already before 1940, Ird, coming from the working class, felt sympathy towards a leftist worldview meaning working class against the power—for that reason he had several collisions with the society order in force. Because of his political views, Ird was a suitable candidate for the theatre director’s post at the Vanemuine. All of his „leavings“ from that post were connected to the repressions of the power that even Kaarel Ird couldn’t escape (in the 1950s he was forced to leave the Vanemuine). In 1948–1949 Ird was the director of ESSR Government of Arts, in 1950–1952 he managed a drama company in Tartu and in 1952–1955 he was the head stage director of Pärnu Endla Theatre. The state honoured him with many high rewards for his long work as theatre and stage director. The controversial person in Ird and his role in the community and his accomplishments as an artist and theatre director still create ambivalent feelings and emotions. Vanemuine was not merely a work placement for Ird but his life’s work. Ird has described his relationship with art in such a way: „Art is work, work and more work. And it is not right that we are ashamed to talk about it as work. Talent is a natural resource. And the community has the right to demand that a person who has been given that natural resource, would handle it favourably. But for an artist to favourably handle his talent means never-ending work with himself.“ Ird in his nature was an enhancer of the world and believed that good art (including theatre art) can make a person to be better. When fighting and debating the power apparatus he was a skillful demagogue and made use of all the system’s weaknesses in order to reach the objective. Surely his complex and angular character was not perfect to run a big collective, and over the years quite a number of conflicts aroused within the collective but also Ird’s critics have readily admitted that his skills and services in developing the Vanemuine theatre are immeasurable. Ird himself has described his relationship with the Vanemuine in a private letter to Olaf Utt with the words: „For me the Vanemuine theatre was part of the Estonian culture /…/, valuable and sacred as the Museum of Literature, Museum of Ethnography, the library of a university/…/. I know that if I left the „Vanemuine“ now there wouldn't be a single person who could sustain the theatre's level. And I even don't know whether I can do that. Especially under the circumstances when we receive little to no help at all.“ (1966)", "Marr has advocated drug law reform and has written candidly about his life experiences: \"I've had a lot of fun on drugs ...

I'm not ashamed of it.\"", "The movement started small in Colorado yet spread across the states becoming a worldwide movement for equality. While there are many poets who helped carry out the movement, Corky Gonzales was able to spread the Chicano issues worldwide through \"The Plan Espiritual de Aztlán.\" This manifesto advocated Chicano nationalism and self-determination for Mexican Americans. In March 1969 it was adopted by the First National Chicano Liberation Youth Conference based in Colorado. Adolfo Ortega says, \"In its core as well as its fringes, the Chicano Movement verged on strivings for economic, social, and political equality.\" This was a simple message that any ordinary person could relate to and want to strive for in their daily lives. Whether someone was talented or not they wanted to help spread the political message in their own way. While majority of the group consisted of Mexican-Americans many people of other nationalities wanted to help the movement. This helped moved the movement from the fringes into the more mainstream political establishment. The \"Political Establishment\" typically consisted of the dominant group or elite that holds power or authority in a nation. Many successful organizations were formed, such as the Mexican American Youth Organization, to fight for civil rights of Mexican Americans. During the early 1960s in Texas many Mexican-Americans were treated like second class citizens and discriminated against. While progress has been made for equality immigrants even to this day are still a target of misunderstanding and fear. Chicano Poetry was a safe way for political messages to spread without fear of being targeted for by speaking out. Politically, the movement was also broken off into sections like chicanismo. \"Chicanismo meant to some Chicanos dignity, self respect, pride, uniqueness, and a feeling of a cultural rebirth.\" Mexican-Americans wanted to embrace the color of their skin instead of it being something to be ashamed of. Many Mexican-Americans unfortunately had it ingrained on them through society that it was better socially and economically to act \"White\" or \"Normal.\" The movement wanted to break that mindset and embrace who they were and be loud and proud of it. A lot of people in the movement thought it was acceptable to speak Spanish to one another and not be ashamed of not being fluent in English. The movement encouraged to not only discuss tradition with other Mexican-Americans but others not within the movement. America was a land of immigrants not just for the social and economically accepted people. The movement made it a point not to exclude others of other cultures but to bring them into the fold to make everyone understanding of one another. While America was new for many people of Latin descent it was important to celebrate what made them who they were as a culture. Entertainment was powerful tool to spread their political message inside and out of their social circles in America. Chicanismo might not be discussed frequently in the mainstream media but the main points of the movement are: self-respect, pride, and cultural rebirth."]}

Prior to 1960, much of the unincorporated area of Clarke County was rural and agricultural. The 1960s brought rapid changes to this environment with the advent of new industries, retail and commercial development, and the construction of planned residential subdivisions.

Many believed that the formation of a county police force similar to others that had been organized in urban areas in the state held promise for bringing the needed improvements in law enforcement services. These concerns and the efforts of the county leadership resulted in the formation of the Clarke County Police Department in 1974.

Technological advances also caused the bassoon's tenor register sound to become more resonant, and playing in this register grew in popularity, especially in the Austro-Germanic musical world. Pedagogues such as Josef Frohlich instructed students to practice scales, thirds, and fourths as vocal students would.

During the Greco-Persian Wars, inhabitants of Asea fought in the historic Battle of Plataea (479BCE). Asea took part in the foundation of Megalopolis, to which city most of its inhabitants removed in 371BCE; but Asea continued to exist as an independent state, since the Aseatae are mentioned, along with the Megalopolitae, Tegeatae, and Pallantieis, as joining Epaminondas before the Battle of Mantineia in 362BCE. At a later time, however, Asea belonged to Megalopolis, as we see from the descriptions of Strabo and Pausanias. The city was in ruins in the time of Pausanias (2nd century), who mentions its acropolis. In its territory, and at the distance of 5 stadia from the city, on the road to Pallantium, were the sources of the Alpheius, and near them those of the Eurotas.

This, in turn, came from Latin genus. Both words mean \"kind\", \"type\", or \"sort\". They derive ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *ǵénh₁- 'to beget', which is also the source of kin, kind, king, and many other English words, with cognates widely attested in many Indo-European languages. It appears in Modern French in the word genre (type, kind, also genre sexuel) and is related to the Greek root gen- (to produce), appearing in gene, genesis, and oxygen. The Oxford Etymological Dictionary of the English Language of 1882 defined gender as kind, breed, sex, derived from the Latin ablative case of genus, like genere natus, which refers to birth. The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of gender as \"kind\" had already become obsolete.", "Κώδων  (Codon) — The Bell", "There was also a racecourse very near the Bellman hostelry which ran from at least 1811 to 1839.

This was the explanation put forward by John Caius, who was one of the most learned men of his time, and had an interest in etymology, in the 16th century. It is supported by considerable historical linguistic evidence, which can be gleaned from such sources as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED): the fact that first uses of the word 'blood' to refer to good breeding in an animal postdate the first use of 'bloodhound'; that other comparable uses, as in 'blood horse' and 'blood stock' appear many centuries later; and that derogatory uses of the word 'bloodhound', which any suggestion of noble breeding would sadly weaken, appear from as early as c. 1400. Other early sources tell us that hounds were supposed to have an interest in blood, and that the Bloodhound was used to follow the trail of a wounded animal.

No signs of activity were reported on the island until 726, when the island suffered an explosive eruption of pumice. Volcanic activity then ceased again until the 1500s, when the development of Palea's sister island Nea Kameni caused increased volcanic activity to be reported. Other ancient authors note that it arose from the sea in 197BCE and was given the name Hiera (), a name frequently given in antiquity to volcanic mountains. This fact is stated by Eusebius, Justin, Strabo, and Plutarch.

In contrast, Thucydides claims to confine himself to factual reports of contemporary political and military events, based on unambiguous, first-hand, eye-witness accounts, although, unlike Herodotus, he does not reveal his sources. Thucydides views life exclusively as political life, and history in terms of political history. Conventional moral considerations play no role in his analysis of political events while geographic and ethnographic aspects are omitted or, at best, of secondary importance. Subsequent Greek historians—such as Ctesias, Diodorus, Strabo, Polybius and Plutarch—held up Thucydides's writings as a model of truthful history. Lucian refers to Thucydides as having given Greek historians their law, requiring them to say what had been done (). Greek historians of the fourth century BC accepted that history was political and that contemporary history was the proper domain of a historian. Cicero calls Herodotus the \"father of history\"; yet the Greek writer Plutarch, in his Moralia (Ethics) denigrated Herodotus, notably calling him a philobarbaros, a \"barbarian lover\", to the detriment of the Greeks. Unlike Thucydides, however, these authors all continued to view history as a source of moral lessons, thereby infusing their works with personal biases generally missing from Thucydides' clear-eyed, non-judgmental writings focused on reporting events in a non-biased manner.", "The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, Kartlos, a great-grandson of Japheth.

The name Sakartvelo (საქართველო) consists of two parts. Its root, kartvel-i (ქართველ-ი), specifies an inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli, or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire. Ancient Greeks (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Tacitus, etc.) referred to early western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi in some Greek sources).
